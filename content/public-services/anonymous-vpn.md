title: Anonymous VPN
---

NYC Mesh allows so-called "anonymous" connections to our [VPN service]({{< relref "intra-mesh-services/vpn" >}}) by way of [our L2TP/IPsec VPN]({{< relref "intra-mesh-services/vpn/l2tp-ipsec" >}}). In this context, *anonymous* simply means that you are welcome to use our publicly-known username (`nycmesh`) and password (`nycmeshnet`), as described on the L2TP/IPsec VPN page linked earlier. It does *not* mean that your connection is untracable by the NYC Mesh VPN endpoint.

For truly anonymous Internet connections, please consider properly using a proper anonymizing tool such as [Tor](https://torproject.org/).
